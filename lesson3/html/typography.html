      <h4>
        Heading Font: Bebas Neue
       
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font is very large and not that difficult to see, so it makes it
        visable to anyone that would be trying to find tabs, specific parts of
        the page, etc.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Lato/Open Sans
       
      </h4>
      <p>
        I went with this font because it was one that paired with the heading
        font, as well as having open clear characters.
