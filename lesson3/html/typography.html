    <h2>Typography</h2>  

      <h2>Heading Font: </h2>
      <p>
        This font is very large and not that difficult to see, so it makes it
        visable to anyone that would be trying to find tabs, specific parts of
        the page, etc.
      </p>

      <h2>Paragraph Font: </h2>
      <p>I went with this font because it was one that paired with the heading
        font, as well as having open clear characters.</p>

      <h2>Normal paragraph example:</h2>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Colored paragraph example:
      </h2>
      <p id="coloredparagraph">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.</p>
