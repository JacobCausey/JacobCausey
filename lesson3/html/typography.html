      <h2>Heading Font:Kosugi Maru </h2>
      <p>
        This font is very large and not that difficult to see, so it makes it
        visable to anyone that would be trying to find tabs, specific parts of
        the page, as well as having some soft edges that could match my color patterns.
      </p>

      <h2>Paragraph Font: Sans Serif</h2>
      <p>I went with this font because it was one that paired with the heading
        font, as well as having open clear characters.</p>

      <h2>Normal paragraph example:</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>
        Colored paragraph example:
      </h2>
      <p id="coloredparagraph">Here's another paragraph example. Idaho weather makes me sad. It's really cold, and dry. Sometimes though, 30 degrees feels like 60 when it's been -10 for a few weeks.</p>
